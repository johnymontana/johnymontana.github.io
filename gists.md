These are a few of my favorite GraphGists...


* [Collaborative Filtering Recommender System](http://gist.neo4j.org/?49a2b9874b37b4a2da4a) - a simple collaborative filtering recommender system is demonstrated using both the Pearson correlation and the Jaccard index.
* [Simple Network Theory Examples](http://gist.neo4j.org/?1bc92b6e3da2bde871ab) - examples of some simple network theory analysis using Neo4j Cypher. Mostly taken from the exercises in Chapters 1-4 in [Networks, Crowds, and Markets](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/)
